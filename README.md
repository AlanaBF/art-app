# Art App

Art App is a fun and interactive drawing application built with HTML5 Canvas. It allows users to draw on a canvas with different colors and line widths, creating unique and colorful pieces of art.

## Features

- Draw on a full-screen canvas with a variety of colors
- Clear the canvas and start a new drawing with a single click
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Usage

To use the Art App, simply visit [https://alanabf.github.io/art-app/](https://alanabf.github.io/art-app/) and start drawing! Click and drag your mouse (or touch and move your finger on mobile devices) to draw on the canvas. The color and line width will change as you draw, creating a rainbow effect.

## Development

This project started as a lesson from Wes Bos's "30 Days of JavaScript" course. It was then further developed and personalized to enhance its features and usability. The original starter code was taken from Day 8 of the course.
